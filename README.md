# juliab: Julia with batteries included

A user friendly way to solve the TTFP (Time To First Plot) problem.
In more words: an easy and non-destructive way to reduce the time from starting
Julia to doing useful work.

## How to install and use

Simply download and add this folder to your path, then type
```
juliab
```

Follow the instructions, wait for it to compile, then next time you want to use Julia, type
```
juliab
```
again, and away you go!

If you ever want to use plain old Julia without the batteries, then type `julia`
and you will find it is unchanged.
If you are feeling particularly brave, you could symlink or alias `julia` to
`juliab`.
